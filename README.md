1.-Case Study.

This document presents a data analysis of a coffee shop located in New York called "Coffe Blend". It operates three different branches and the analysis provided a clearer understanding of the business's overall performance and helped identify areas for improvement based on the collected data.
A combination of tables, pivot tables, functions, and formulas in Excel was used to conduct the analysis. The results were then presented in a dashboard, also created in Excel.
